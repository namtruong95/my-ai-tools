# Skill upstream maintenance

Last checked: 2026-10-07. Repository base: `163951e` (PR #417).

`skills/` is canonical. The Amp bundle in
`configs/amp/plugins/my-ai-tools-skills/skills/` must contain identical files.
The Claude marketplace points directly to canonical directories. `generate.sh`
exports installed home configuration; it is not an upstream skill updater.

## Refresh policy

- Read local history before replacing an upstream-inspired skill. Preserve local
  tool names, resource paths, approval rules, and intentional workflow changes.
- Fetch upstream text at a recorded commit. Review scripts, hooks, MCP startup,
  credential access, network destinations, and external-state changes before import.
- Copy changed canonical bundles to the Amp mirror and run the mirror test.
- Recommendations are live upstream installations, not vendored or locked bundles.
  A checked commit records the review point, not a promise that a future install
  uses that revision. Review executable content again before installation or use.

The October 2 refresh was an unpushed commit on another executor. Its thread was
read for the method and decisions; its patch was not copied. This refresh compares
current files directly with current upstream sources. Later local changes take
precedence, including the restored `babysit-pr` and first-party `visual-pr`.

Keep portable metadata and plan gate. |
| `portless-local` | [vercel-labs/portless@7abf4df](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless/commit/7abf4df5d939fe3b527a120e20bc270c681c3536), latest release v0.15.7 | Update workspace/configuration support, state directory, diagnostics, sharing, routing, and framework flag limits.

Keep seven compact local templates and standalone operation; do not import GSD SDK dependencies. Reject invalid scope rather than falling back to a whole-repository scan. |

| `code-review`, `implement-spec`, `pr`, `retro`, `tdd` | Same Matt Pocock revision | Keep local adaptations: portable context discovery, safe worktree integration, PR evidence, human-selected retrospectives, and Red-Green-Refactor. Do not require absent setup skills, invent issue-tracker configuration, or import upstream resets. |
| `prd`, `ralph` | [snarktank/ralph@6c53cb0](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph/commit/6c53cb0b831ebe8739c6a003e22af14902d8b0b5) | No applicable behavioral update; retain local metadata and formatting. |
| `tmux` | [mitsuhiko/agent-stuff@0865c84](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/commit/0865c849befd2021490679f96a8dee58c84ac857) | Preserve intentional LogPilot/socket adaptation. |
| `visual-pr` | [humanlayer/skills@ca7c808](https://github.com/humanlayer/skills/commit/ca7c8088db69e315a8b2deea43820270457f8f3c) | Preserve first-party marked-comment publisher; upstream replaces the PR body. Keep comment template and publisher tests. |
| `babysit-pr` | [openai/codex@5e96aab](https://github.com/openai/codex/commit/5e96aabd68dc6194f5ad928cb7f5d0bc71b72df9), final pre-removal source | Current upstream path returns 404. Preserve the explicitly restored local watcher and its tests; do not remove it again. |

The following 22 skills are local designs or adaptations of ideas/standards, not
maintained upstream file copies. Their current repository versions remain canonical:

`accountable-engineering`, `adr`, `blindspot-pass`, `capability-experiments`,
`code-quality-review`, `commit-atomic`, `context-discovery`, `doc-search`,
`docs-update`, `draft-pull-request`, `git-context`, `handoffs`,
`implementation-logger`, `llm-wiki`, `orchestrating-fusion`, `pickup`, `pr-review`,
`qmd-knowledge`, `quiz-me`, `security-audit`, `slop`, `spec-interview`.

The 15 tool-specific SKILL.md files under `configs/{amp,cline,kimi-code}/skills/`
are local adapters for `code-reviewer`, `test-generator`, `documentation-writer`,
`ai-slop-remover`, and `security-audit`. They have no independent external upstream;
keep their tool-specific guidance. Do not replace the short adapter security skill
with the larger canonical audit workflow.

## Recommendations: 21 entries, 20 repositories checked

All checked repositories are reachable and unarchived; API trees were not truncated.
Named skill selectors were checked against frontmatter, not only directory names.
In particular, Engram's `plugin/claude-code/skills/memory/SKILL.md` declares
`name: engram-memory`; the existing selector is correct despite the directory name.
Collection entries remain live collections; this check is not a security audit of
every skill they may install. Preserve the local pstack-first order.

## Security review notes

- No new executable scripts, hooks, MCP declarations, endpoints, or credentials
  are imported by this refresh. Existing scripts remain unchanged.
- Portless may change trust stores and hosts files, expose servers, install a
  root/SYSTEM startup service, or terminate processes. The local skill now makes
  those approval boundaries explicit. Do not print TLS keys or ngrok tokens.
- Codemap's supplementary secret check prints only filenames. It does not prove
  absence of all secrets. Invalid scope does not authorize wider exploration.
- Plannotator JSON can contain private goal details. Keep it in the goal directory;
  browser idleness is not permission to terminate the user's session. Commands use
  direct stdout redirection so a pipeline cannot hide a CLI failure.
- Engram hooks perform session writes, import Git-synced memory, and may start a
  local server with cloud autosync enabled. Cloud transmission depends on configured
  credentials/settings. Review those settings and consent before enabling cloud sync
  or an external `ENGRAM_URL`; installing a skill alone is not installing its hooks.
- Visual Recap normally publishes to hosted Plan MCP. Use its supported
  `AGENT_NATIVE_PLANS_MODE=local-files` mode when hosted database writes are not
  authorized. This refresh does not change personal environment settings.
- Autoreview sends captured diffs/source to a reviewer provider and deliberately
  has no pre-transmission secret scanner. Reviewer findings occur **after** sending.
  Run approved local secret checks first and authorize provider transmission. Its
  executable isolates reviewer credentials/settings; do not weaken isolation.
- Jevgrep and Last 30 Days use external providers and saved credentials. Do not
  ask for keys in chat, print them, or execute imported setup scripts during a refresh.
- Live collection installs and upstream CLI downloads remain a supply-chain risk.
  The snapshot above is not a blanket security approval for their current or future
  scripts. No upstream helper was executed for this refresh.

## Validation on this refresh

- Full Bats suite with PyYAML and jsonschema: 589 passed, 1 failed. The failure,
  `validate_config_with_schema fails when schema mismatches`, also reproduces on
  the unchanged base. Its unquoted shell heredoc expands `$schema` to an empty
  key, so the fixture does not declare a schema. Leave that unrelated bug unchanged.
- Focused recommendation and Amp bundle tests: 75 passed.
- Bun tests: 48 passed; TypeScript typecheck passed.
- Babysit PR watcher tests: 5 passed.
- Shell syntax, token-efficiency sync, installer/export dry runs, mirror equality,
  and skill frontmatter checks passed. No real installation was run.
- Changed JSON passes Biome. Full repository Biome reports 427 errors and one
  informational diagnostic, identical to the unchanged base. No unrelated
  formatting changes are included.
